# EasyEffects Presets
These are presets I've been working on for weeks and tested thoroughly on 2 laptops with various types of music, vastly improving quality in most of the cases. Initially it was supposed to be a preset imitating the Windows B&O EQ for my HP Pavilion Aero 13, but it turned out to work just as good on my friend's Tuxedo laptop as well. It also sounded well on various types of headphones and earphones.

**SoundPerfection** is based on [LoudnessEqualizer by DigitalOne1](https://github.com/Digitalone1/EasyEffects-Presets). It has been tweaked to allow for more consistent volume boost and sound enrichment (V-shaped EQ, creating more depth) without compromising on the overall quality of the sound.

**Bang&Olufsen Beta** is an independent EQ with similar sound profile and bass enhancement, but without LE trickery for volume boost (which does not seem to have much effect anymore, anyway). It seems to work better on newer versions of EasyEffects, but might distort a little.

Since it's been created with laptops in mind and tested on them as well, it's generally tailored and targeted for them. But you can try it regardless, share your opinion and/or and tweak to your liking!

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have **EasyEffects 6.2.7 or higher**<sup>1</sup> with its plugin dependencies installed.

<sub>1. For SoundPerfection. B&O Beta doesn't use gate plugin and will work with versions starting from 6.1.0.</sub>

I am by no means a sound expert and this preset has been created through experimenting in a trial and error fashion. If this preset works well on your machine with tweaks, consider forking the repository, adding these tweaks and making a pull request. Thank you! ❤️
