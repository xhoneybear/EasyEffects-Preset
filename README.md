# SoundPerfection
This is a preset I've been working on for weeks and tested thoroughly on 2 laptops with various types of music, vastly improving quality in most of the cases. Initially it was supposed to be a preset imitating the Windows B&O EQ for my HP Pavilion Aero 13, but it turned out to work just as good on my friend's Tuxedo laptop as well. It also sounded well on various types of headphones and earphones.

The preset is based on **[LoudnessEqualizer](https://github.com/Digitalone1/EasyEffects-Presets) by [DigitalOne1](https://github.com/Digitalone1)**. It has been tweaked to allow for more consistent **volume boost** and **sound enrichment** (V-shaped EQ, creating more depth) without compromising on the overall quality of the sound.

Since it's been created with laptops in mind and tested on them as well, I generally recommend this for laptop users, but you can try it on other types of devices and let me know how it sounds!
